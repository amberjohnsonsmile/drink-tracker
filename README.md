# DrinkTracker Project Proposal

## Project Description







[] Think "Elevator Pitch". Succinctly, but completely describe what you'll be building
[] After reading the project description, it is clear what the project aims to accomplish

## Problem statement

With ample opportunities for free drinks in the tech community, it can be easy to lose track of just how much alcohol you're drinking.

## How will your project solve this problem?

DrinkTracker provides an easy way to increase awareness, set goals, and enjoy all that free beer in a healthy way.

## Map the user experience

The user will open the app and see the landing page.



[] When the user opens your app, what happens? What information does your app need from your user? What does it output in return?
[] The user experience is described in full, including any inputs/outputs that experience will require

## What technologies do you plan to use?

* React Native - frontend for mobile app
* Express - server
* Knex.js - database queries
* PostgreSQL - database
* Heroku - host backend server and database
* Cypress - end to end testing
* Google Sign-In (stretch) - allow a user to sign in with Google
