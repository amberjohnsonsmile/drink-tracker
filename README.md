# Project proposal

## Project Description
Think "Elevator Pitch". Succinctly, but completely describe what you'll be building
After reading the project description, it is clear what the project aims to accomplish

## Problem statement
What problem is your app solving? Who has it?

## How will your project solve this problem?
The relationship between the stated problem and the project is clearly defined

## Map the user experience
When the user opens your app, what happens? What information does your app need from your user? What does it output in return?
The user experience is described in full, including any inputs/outputs that experience will require

## What technologies do you plan to use?
This should be a complete list, including APIs. Be prepared to defend the items on this list. This means you should research the technologies/APIs, and know why you're planning to use each.
