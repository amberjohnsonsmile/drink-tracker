# DrinkTracker Project Proposal

## Project Description

DrinkTracker allows you to keep track of how many alcoholic drinks you consume on a daily and weekly basis. The app also provides tools for goal setting and looking back at patterns.

## Problem statement

With ample opportunities for free drinks in the tech community, it can be easy to lose track of just how much alcohol you're drinking.

## How will your project solve this problem?

DrinkTracker provides an easy way to increase awareness, set goals, and enjoy all that free beer in a healthy way.

## Map the user experience

The user will open the app and see the landing page. They will then move on to the calendar page, where they will have the option to click on a date and add a drink. There will be a navigation bar on the side linking to "goals" and an "about" page. The goals page will allow the user to add, edit, and delete goals. The about page will give general info about the app.

## What technologies do you plan to use?

* React Native - frontend for mobile app
* Express - server
* Knex.js - database queries
* PostgreSQL - database
* Heroku - host backend server and database
* Cypress - end to end testing
* Google Sign-In (stretch) - allow a user to sign in with Google
* Google Calendar API (stretch) - integrate with user's calendar events
